### [Whether to Apply](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2023.4907) <i> Management Science, 2023 </i> <br>
with [Katherine Baldiga Coffman](https://sites.google.com/site/kbaldigacoffman/) and Leena Kulkarni <br>
<p> <b><i>Abstract:</i></b> Labor market outcomes depend, in part, upon an individual’s willingness to put herself forward 
for different opportunities. We use a series of experiments to explore gender differences in willingness to apply for 
higher return, more challenging work. We find that, in male-typed domains, qualified women are significantly less likely 
to apply than similarly well-qualified men. We provide evidence both in a controlled setting and in the field that reducing 
ambiguity surrounding required qualifications increases the rate at which qualified women apply. The effects are more mixed 
for men. Our results suggest a path for increasing the pool of qualified women applicants. </p>


### [Stereotypes and Belief Updating](https://academic.oup.com/jeea/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/jeea/jvad063/7333976?redirectedFrom=fulltext) <i> Journal of European Economic Association, 2023 </i>
with [Katherine Baldiga Coffman](https://sites.google.com/site/kbaldigacoffman/) and Leena Kulkarni <br>
<p> <b><i>Abstract:</i></b> We explore how feedback shapes, and perpetuates, gender gaps in self-assessments. Participants 
in our experiments take tests of their ability across different domains. Absent feedback, beliefs of own 
ability are strongly influenced by gender stereotypes: holding own ability fixed, individuals are more 
confident in more gender congruent domains (i.e. more male-typed for men, more female-typed for 
women). After feedback, stereotypes continue to shape posterior beliefs, even beyond what a Bayesian 
model would predict. This is primarily because both men and women update their beliefs more positively 
in response to good news when it arrives in a more gender congruent domain. </p>
