### [Whether to Apply](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2023.4907) <i> Management Science, 2023 </i> <br>
with [Katherine Baldiga Coffman](https://sites.google.com/site/kbaldigacoffman/) and Leena Kulkarni <br>
<p> <b><i>Abstract:</i></b> Labor market outcomes depend, in part, upon an individual’s willingness to put herself forward 
for different opportunities. We use a series of experiments to explore gender differences in willingness to apply for 
higher return, more challenging work. We find that, in male-typed domains, qualified women are significantly less likely 
to apply than similarly well-qualified men. We provide evidence both in a controlled setting and in the field that reducing 
ambiguity surrounding required qualifications increases the rate at which qualified women apply. The effects are more mixed 
for men. Our results suggest a path for increasing the pool of qualified women applicants. </p>


### [Stereotypes and Belief Updating](https://academic.oup.com/jeea/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/jeea/jvad063/7333976?redirectedFrom=fulltext) <i> Journal of European Economic Association, 2023 </i>
with [Katherine Baldiga Coffman](https://sites.google.com/site/kbaldigacoffman/) and Leena Kulkarni <br>
<p> <b><i>Abstract:</i></b> We explore how feedback shapes, and perpetuates, gender gaps in self-assessments. Participants 
in our experiments take tests of their ability across different domains. Absent feedback, beliefs of own 
ability are strongly influenced by gender stereotypes: holding own ability fixed, individuals are more 
confident in more gender congruent domains (i.e. more male-typed for men, more female-typed for 
women). After feedback, stereotypes continue to shape posterior beliefs, even beyond what a Bayesian 
model would predict. This is primarily because both men and women update their beliefs more positively 
in response to good news when it arrives in a more gender congruent domain. </p>


# Working Papers

### [Workplace Hostility](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VGVEnj4kx6mM2r8ofmQBy7A5C2Uq7sqD/view) <i> 2024 </i>
with [Clémentine Van Effenterre](https://sites.google.com/site/vaneffenterreclementine/home) <br>
<p> <b><i>Abstract:</i></b> Workplace hostility is one of the main drivers of employee resignation. We investigate how much individuals value a workplace free of hostility and whether this can be offset with hybrid or solo work arrangements. We conduct a choice survey experiment with 2,048 participants, recruited among upper-year students, recent graduates, and alums from a large public university. Our experiment shows that people are willing to forgo a significant portion of their earnings to avoid hostile work environments—15 to 30 percent of their wage. Women report a stronger preference for inclusive workplaces and environments free of sexual harassment. We also find that women value hybrid work twice as much in the presence of sexual harassment and value teamwork more in non- inclusive environments. We propose a model of compensating differentials to understand how the presence of hostility shapes the demand for alternative work arrangements and to implement policy counterfactuals. <br>
