[Whether to Apply](http://manuelacollis.github.io/files/2023_02_Whether_to_Apply.pdf) <i> accepted at Management Science, 2023 </i> <br>

with [Katherine Baldiga Coffman](https://sites.google.com/site/kbaldigacoffman/) and Leena Kulkarni <br>

<b><i>Abstract:</i></b> Labor market outcomes depend, in part, upon an individualâ€™s willingness to put herself 

forward for different opportunities. We use a series of experiments to explore gender differences 

in willingness to apply for higher return, more challenging work. We find that, in male-typed 

domains, qualified women are significantly less likely to apply than similarly well-qualified men. 

We provide evidence both in a controlled setting and in the field that reducing ambiguity 

surrounding required qualifications increases the rate at which qualified women apply. The effects 

are more mixed for men. Our results suggest a path for increasing the pool of qualified women 

applicants.
