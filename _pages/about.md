I am a doctoral student at Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto.

I hold a MA in Law and Diplomacy from the Fletcher School at Tufts University, USA, and a BSc in Business Administration with Specialization in Banking and Finance from Bern University of Applied Sciences, Switzerland. Prior to joining the Ph.D. Program, I was a Research Associate at Harvard Business School.

With my research, I explore how gender influences our contributions and outcomes in challenging settings with the potential for high reward such as entrepreneurship, innovation, executives, and board.

In my first line of work, I study which normative and structural conditions influence a qualified and talented individual to contribute their knowledge, especially in challenging but highly rewarding settings. My two working papers Stereotypes and Belief Updating and Whether to Apply are examples of this line of work. I use laboratory experiments, online field experiments, and simulated labor markets to study these questions. In my second stream of work, I study gender gaps in the setting of entrepreneurship and innovation.
