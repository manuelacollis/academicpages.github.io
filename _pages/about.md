I am a doctoral student in Strategic Management at Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto and a PhD Fellow at the [Institute for Gender and the Economy (Gate)](https://www.gendereconomy.org/).

I hold a MA in Law and Diplomacy from the Fletcher School at Tufts University, USA, and a BSc in Business Administration with Specialization in Banking and Finance from Bern University of Applied Sciences, Switzerland. Prior to joining the Ph.D. Program, I was a Research Associate at Harvard Business School.

With my research, I explore how gender influences our contributions and outcomes in challenging settings with the potential for high reward such as entrepreneurship, innovation, executives, and board.

In my first line of work, I study which normative and structural conditions influence a qualified and talented individual to contribute their knowledge, especially in challenging but highly rewarding settings. My three papers Stereotypes and Belief Updating,  Whether to Apply, and Workplace Hostility are examples of this line of work. I use laboratory experiments, online field experiments, and simulated labor markets to study these questions. 

In my second stream of work, I study gender gaps in the setting of entrepreneurship and innovation.
