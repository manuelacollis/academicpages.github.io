# On Research Questions

Paul Graham on how to do good work<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/greatwork.html">link to blog post</a>

## Advice I have come across 
Here I list advice that has been shared with me. If you see your advice listed here and are comfortable with adding your name, I'm happy to turn it into a quote.
<br> <br>

<u>On Research Questions & Paper Ideas </u>
- <b>Don't write a paper somebody else will write within the next six months. </b> <i>This advice reminds me that we serve science best by we find our comparative advantage (be it perspective, approach, methods). </i>
- <b>Work on research questions firms are not going to study. </b>  <i> I found this helpful as it reminds me when that an increased reliance of firm data also increases the risk of biasing science since firms will get to decide (to an extend) what questions we are allowed to study.</i>

<u>On Polishing Papers </u>
- <b> Research questions are stronger when 1) the topic interests a general academic audience, not just yourself adn 2) the alternative hypothesis - and not just the main hypothesis - is strong. Don't just tell us what your contribution is but get buy-in early in the paper on WHY the question is important. Identify the three take-aways of your paper adn make sure everything - from the intro to the tables/graphs is building up to them. </b> ~Anya Samek on Twitter
