excerpt: 'Labor market outcomes depend, in part, upon an individual’s willingness to put herself 
forward for different opportunities. We use a series of experiments to explore gender differences 
in willingness to apply for higher return, more challenging work. We find that, in male-typed 
domains, qualified women are significantly less likely to apply than similarly well-qualified men. 
We provide evidence both in a controlled setting and in the field that reducing ambiguity 
surrounding required qualifications increases the rate at which qualified women apply. The effects 
are more mixed for men. Our results suggest a path for increasing the pool of qualified women 
applicants.'
